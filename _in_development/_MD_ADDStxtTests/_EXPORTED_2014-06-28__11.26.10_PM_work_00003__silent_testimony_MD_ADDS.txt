-MWG:Description="Thank you, Brothers and Sisters, for your testimonies. Also, thank you to those of you who bore your testimonies silently. Brother Hall has produced a painting which we thought it would be appropriate to hang in the foyer. What? What's funny about it? Why are some of you laughing? I think it's a nice painting. ~ See http://s.earthbound.io/1x for archive, original, print and usage options. ~ A hoity-toity robot talks about this at http://s.earthbound.io/artgib"
