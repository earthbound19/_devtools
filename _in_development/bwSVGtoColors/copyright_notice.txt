Copyright 2015 Richard Alexander Hall, all rights reserved. Original raster art produced via OneMillionAlphas Filter Forge filter. Converted to many .svg files in many colors through custom autoHotkey scripting and the free command-line tools nconvert, potrace, and ImageMagick (convert). This svg itself created by potrace 1.12, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2015, though the colors specified in it were changed by autoHotkey search-replace/file copy functions.
