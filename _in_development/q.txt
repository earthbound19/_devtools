My comment and "answer" which I deleted after spotting the inconsistency:

[comment] By design, rmdir does not remove directories that contain files. For a trick to wipe directories with files in them, see my answer.

[answer] rm and rmdir (one is an alias for the other) do not delete files in directories by design; they are only meant to remove empty directories.

You can "trick" robocopy to wipe everything in a folder (including all files in all subfolders, and the subfolders themselves) this way:

MKDIR emptyStubDir
ROBOCOPY emptyStubDir someFolderYouWantToDelete /E /PURGE
