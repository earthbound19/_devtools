With a primarily blue image, the numbers below show the colors I see resulting from blue-shifting various hue shift values for the nConvert HSL filter. Here is an example command that converts blues to oranges:

nConvert [image input parameter] -hls -47 0 0 [image output parameter]

Since I'm only shifting hue, I'm giving only the first of the three hls parameters (hue, where the others are lightness and saturation).

The maximum negative and positive shift ranges are -127 and 127, respectively, as opposed to Photoshop (PS), where that is -180 and 180. With trial and error and algebra, I found a multiplier constant that will convert all PS hue shift values to their exact equivalent in nConvert. That constant is:

0.285714285714286

The usage of that constant is:
psHueShiftValue * 0.285714285714286

The following hue shifts are shown as nConvert/PS equivalents, as found starting with an image that is a gradient of cyan to blue:

-7 / -23, green-cyan to cyan-blue
-13 / -45, cyan-green to cyan
-20 / -67, green to cyan-green
-34 / -120, yellow to green
-37 / -131, yellow-yellow orange to yellow-green
-41 / -144, orange to yellow-yellow-green
-45 / -159, red to yellow
-51 / -180, red to orange
-64 / 134, 
46 / 162, red-red-magenta to red-red orange
44 / 154, red-magenta to red-red orange
41 / 144, magenta red to red
37 / 129, red-magenta to barely magenta red
33 / 118, magenta magenta violet (or just magenta? )to magenta magenta red (or just violet?)
31 / 109, magenta violet to magenta red
30 / 108, violet violet magenta to magenta magenta red
28 / 100, violet magenta to magenta
24 / 87, violet to magenta magenta violet
15 / 54, blue to violet
8 / 29, cyan blue to blue


-47 0 -51 looks cool starting with primarily blues.
