The "Bedstead" font has great glyphs, and the block characters not where I expect. Tall though, where I want square.
InputSans-Light.ttf has sqaure glyphs, and finder holes in the hash block characters, but not an open license. Not selected.
"Symbola" has the block characters, and many other interesting glyphs, open license, the block characters almost square, not open license.
BabelStone Shapes has square block characters, square, open license, if I make money with this art I am paying a donation amount. SELECTED.
