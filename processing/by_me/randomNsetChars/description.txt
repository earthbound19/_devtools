Animated block character noise programmed in the Processing language. The Processing script randomly selects a characters from this set:

▔▀▆▄▂▌▐█▊▎░▒▓▖▗▘▙▚▛▜▝▞▟

-- and repeatedly fills the screen with a random selection of characters from that subset, as it randomly morphs the background and fill color through palettes.

Examples of subsets the script might select and then randomly fill the screen with:
