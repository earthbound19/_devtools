silly simple (I overcomplicated this before I looked it up): https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/149800/how-do-i-calculate-the-number-of-different-combinations-of-multiple-sets-elemen

possible combination of controls in this filter, from possible numbers in each set:
frame width: 4
frame margin: 4
frame corners: 3
frame bevel: 4
checker H: 3
checker V: 3
checker inclined: 2
kaleido offset H: 8
kaleido offset V: 8
kaliedo shape size: 10
H V C or K: 4
high pass radius: 100, but let's break that up into increments of 4, so: 20

4 * 4 * 3 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 8 * 8 * 10 * 4 * 20 =
176,947,200

~177 million possible combinations, but some different control combinations can produce the same result.

V2
possible combinations of poly/frame checker choices:

poly
poly invert
frame
frame invert

GIVES 6 possible combinations (pick 2):
poly, poly invert
poly, frame
poly, frame invert
~
poly invert, frame
poly invert, frame invert
~
frame, frame invert

V3? Alt controls?
- unchecking monochrome on high pass and forwarding to desaturate various modes produces (more?) interesting grayscale patterns.
- median, minimum, or maximum on the output (or maybe also just before the high pass) produces interesting variations that adjust the amount of black, white and gray. median especially alters things more.
