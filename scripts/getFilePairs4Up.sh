# DESCRIPTION
# For all files of type $1 in the current directory, searches for files of type $2 that have the same base file name (file minus extension) which reside up to $3 directories up from the current directory, and moves them into the current directory. Checks for and will not move files to the current directory that would clobber (overwrite) files, and logs those duplicates to a file it notifies of at end of script run.

# USAGE
# Run with these parameters:
# - $1 extension of file types in current directory to find files with the same base name (file minus extension).
# - $2 extension of file types to find that have the same base name as any file $1 plus this extension.
# - $3 how many directories up to search for files $2 and move them into the current directory.
# - $4 OPTIONAL. Force overwrite existing files in the current directory, by moving found matches from any directory up to $3 levels up over them.
# EXAMPLE
# Suppose you've got some files named `rnd_43aB.png` and `rnd43Cd.png` in the current path, which you rendered from source files `rnd_43aB.flame` and `rnd43Cd.flame`, which are two directories up from the current directory, and you want to move those matching `.flame` files into the current directory. To move those matching `.flame` files from up to two parent directories down to the current directory, run this script with these parameters:
#    getFilePairs4Up.sh png flame 2
# This will result in all those matching `.flame` file names being moved from up to two directories above into this directory.
# NOTES
# - The script will not overwrite existing files in the current directory with identically named files from any parent directory. If it finds duplicate file names, it will log the full paths to the duplicates to a file named something like this: `getFilePairs4Up_run_EB213A_log.txt`
# - To override that safe behavior and force overwrite existing files, pass anything for parameter $4. Adapting the example to that purpose, the command to do that would be:
#
#    getFilePairs4Up.sh png flame 2 KRIDTALB
