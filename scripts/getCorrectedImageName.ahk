; TO DO: Move this out of the _devtools/bin path to a proper permanent tools path.
; TO DO: See if the text files given in USAGE below are even used (or could be).

; DESCRIPTION:
; Creates a batch file, _rename_images.txt (rename it to a .bat file to use it), which renames all files in a directory tree such that windows and 'nix envrionments will handle the files without errors from special characters, etc. Optionally and in development: it will shorten the files to a specified length. It also outputs two lists; one of the original file names (imgs_original_names.txt) and another of the proposed modified file names (imgs_new_names.txt). To keep a record of renames, or for other purposes.

; USAGE: To be written . . . 

; NOTES: 1) This script will not work as expected called from a cygwin shell if you call the .ahk version of this. However, if you compile this script to a .exe, it will work from cygwin. 2) File names passed to this which include spaces (' ') must be surrouned by double-quote marks.


; TO DO: update the following doc. per conditional param. %3%.
; USAGE: This script expects three parameters. The first two should be surrounded by double quote marks ", the first being a path to work in, the second being a file in that path to work upon, and the third being a length to shorten the file name to. If the given file is shorter than or equal to the length to shorten to, it will not shorten the file name. All three parameters must be given, and in that order. NOTES: The text files it creates are imgs_original_names.txt and imgs_proposed_new_names.txt; *it only ever appends* to these text files. This means they add to the text files, but never blank or delete them. Consequently, anytime you wish to recreate those lists with a series of runs of this program, you must first blank or delete those files. LASTLY, if you have spaces in any of the directories in the path to the image files this script uses, it will probably break functionality. Ensure there are only e.g. underscores _ in the PATH, no spaces.

; TO DO: Get this properly renaming some files it won't rename (with special characters); AND/OR warn user of impossible to handle characters in file names (list them if possible); as the varize() function may not process those characters (and the characters would cause errors if in variables).

#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
#NoTrayIcon
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
