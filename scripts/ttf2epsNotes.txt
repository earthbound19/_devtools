To build on mac:
gcc ttf2eps.c -o ttf2eps

bare example:
./ttf2eps -unicode 0021 arial.ttf

--may produce e.g. glyph4.eps (an exclamation mark)! :)

run script on mac, with e.g. arial.ttf in the same path as ttf2eps:
chmod 777 ./ttf2epsLatin.sh && ./ttf2epsLatin.sh arial.ttf

To build on Windows via cygwin / mingw32:

good luck. I tried:

x86_64-pc-cygwin-gcc.exe ttf2eps.c -o ttf2eps

--or maybe try using whatever cygwin gcc compiler could be used--there are at least two that I see in /usr/bin--but when I ran it from e.g. the cygwin /usr/bin dir with the above bare example command and the given .ttf file in the same directory, it did nothing.
