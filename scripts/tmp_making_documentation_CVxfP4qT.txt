Renders a PNG image like bacteria that mutate color as they spread.

An earlier incarnation of this script by earthbound19 was dramatically sped up by changes
from one GitHub user "scribblemaniac" (like many orders of magnitude faster--an image
that used to take 7 minutes to render now takes 5 seconds).

Output file names are based on the date and time and random characters.
Inspired and drastically evolved from color_fibers.py, which was horked and adapted
from https://scipython.com/blog/computer-generated-contemporary-art/

USAGE
Run this script without any parameters, and it will use a default set of parameters:
python color_growth.py
To see available parameters, run this script with the --help switch:
python color_growth.py --help

DEPENDENCIES
python 3 with numpy, queue, and pyimage modules installed (and others--see the import
statements).

KNOWN ISSUES
See help for --RANDOM_SEED.


TO DO:
- figure out whether I broke RND continuity? It would seem
the same presets are no longer producing the same results?
- isolate what situation didn't create a new preset / anim folder
when I expected it to, and fix that (or document in help).
- make naming convention of variables consistent? I think I'm
all over the place with this . . . :p
- possibly things in the color_growth_v1.py's TO DO list.
- determine whether any code in the fast fork (now this script)
is leftover from color_growth_v1.py, and delete them?
- make it properly use negative or > 8 growth-clip values again?
since the color_growth_fast.py fork it isn't.

VERSION HISTORY
v2.8.3:
- Trivial comment/docstring tweaks for better readability.
