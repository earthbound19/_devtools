REM NOTE: It's possible you may need to manually switch to session 0's desktop (I think there's a way to do that with paexec) and run OHW and configure it with a manual run of it first. Or copy the .ini to some system folder?

ECHO This doesn't work at the moment; hack it:
REM paexec -w "C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Hardware Monitor" -d -s -i -x "C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Hardware Monitor\OpenHardWareMonitor.exe"
