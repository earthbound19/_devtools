# DESCRIPTION
# Makes a directory tree of randomly named folders and possibly subfolders, and random files of certain types (hackable, see NOTES), optionally with terminal unfriendly characters (see USAGE). The result random directory tree is in a subfolder named testFiles. The script deletes that directory tree and re-creates it on each run.
# See also FileTool: https://tools.stefankueng.com/FileTool.html

# USAGE
# Run with an optional parameter:
# - $1 OPTIONAL. Any string (such as 'POLSDERF'), which will cause the script to allow terminal-unfriendly characters (see ftun.sh) in file names. If omitted, the character set used to generate file names (unless hacked by you to something else) is a-km-z2-9 (which excludes characters that can be confused for each other such as lowercase L and 1).
# Example that will generate a tree with randomly named files and folders, without terminal-unfriendly characters in their names:
#    makeRNDtestFilesTree.sh
# Example that will generate a tree with randomly named files and folders, which may also include terminal-unfriendly characters in their names:
#    makeRNDtestFilesTree.sh POLSDERF
# NOTES
# - To alter the characteristics of the randomly generated directory tree, see and alter the global variables immediately under the "CODE" comment.
# - This script makes multiple randomly named files of given types (see the fileTypesToMake variable) with the same base file name, e.g. floofarf.hexplt and floofarf.png, norbwahl.hexplt and norbwahl.png, etc.).
