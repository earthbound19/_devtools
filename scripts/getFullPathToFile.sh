# DESCRIPTION
# Searches the operating system PATH for a script file name $1 (parameter 1) and prints the full path to it if found. First tries `which`, which is a lot faster, and if that fails, searches every directory in $PATH. Can help other scripts find the full path to a script they rely on and use, if they capture and utilize the printed output from this.

# USAGE
# Suppose you have a script that calls other scripts which you know are in your PATH, but it's inconvenient and/or impractical to hard-code the full path to those other scripts in your script. On top of that, the `which` and `realpath` commands fail to find a file which you know exists in your $PATH on MSYS2 (and maybe other emulated Unix-like environments).
# Run this script with these parameters:
# - $1 the file name of a script you want the full path to
# For example, if the script you want the full path to is color_growth.py, run this script with only that, like this:
#    getFullPathToScript.sh color_growth.py
# If this script finds the full path to it, it will print it, e.g.:
#    /c/_ebDev/scripts/imgAndVideo/color_growth.py
# You may exploit this print from any other script that wants that full path, by assigning it to a variable. For example, in another script, you might do this:
#    pathToScript=$(getFullPathToScript.sh color_growth.py)
#    python $pathToScript $colorGrowthPyParameters
# NOTE
# This script was created because the `which` command apparently doesn't actually search every directory in the $PATH on MSYS2, or if it does, something with it is broken on my setup for some files I try to find with it.


# CODE
if ! [ "$1" ]; then printf "\nNo parameter \$1 (script file name to find the full path to) passed to script. Exit."; exit; else fileNameToFind=$1; fi
# If `which` works, it is _much_ faster, so try it first:

# Note to self: 2>/dev/null redirects stderror if there are errors; if there are not errors it will not redirect, but will print to stdout:
fullPathToFile=$(which $fileNameToFind 2>/dev/null)
# The preceding command will cause $fullPathToFile to be blank if no useful result was found, but if the result was useful it will be non-blank. So, if non-blank, print and exit. Otherwise do nothing and fall through to the remainder of the script that uses a slower search method than `which`:
if [ "$fullPathToFile" != "" ]
then
	echo $fullPathToFile
	# no need to do anything further with script in this case, so exit:
	exit 0
fi

# If `which` failed, use full manual path search:
IFS=':'
for directory in $PATH
do
	if [ -d $directory ]
	then
		# This searches for an exact name and prints nothing if it fails; we can therefore check an empty variable for failure and non-empty variable for success:
		fullPathToFile=$(find $directory -maxdepth 1 -name $fileNameToFind)
		if [ "$fullPathToFile" != "" ]
		then
			echo $fullPathToFile
			break
		fi
	fi
done
