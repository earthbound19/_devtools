MsgString = WARNING: Back up your files first! This program has no guarantees or warranty and could mess things up.`n`nNOTE: If you have a lot of files you *don't* want tagged with new numbers, and which are similarly named (e.g. "variant 01," "var. 02," "variation 05," etc.), this program may mess up in numbering. You can control for that by file naming. If you name every alternate/variation file "variant;" this program will deliberately ignore (not renumber) all those files.`n`nNOTE: Although this program sorts tagged files into new folders by number, if you have any files tagged _final already within a numbered folder, it will ignore the folder numbering, and number the tagged file regardless (which could result in files with a higher number in a lower-numbered folder). To avoid that happening where not intended, make sure that all _final files in any numbered folder are properly, similarly numbered!

/* Overly many notes copied into a comment block:
Make good documentation.

TO DO? : Add notes to documentation:

NOTE: For this program to work as intended, you must follow the rules of naming files after this convention:
Offset the files you want counted with dashes or underscores (- or _). (It may be ok not to do this if the number is at the start of a filename.) Do not prefix the first underscore with the word "Library" or "Lib" (as some names generated from my batch scripts for Filter Forge do), and do not prefix or postfix the characters period or x (. or x or X).

I've tested whether files with the label _final in folders that also have that label will be numbered twice, and that seems not to be the case. But don't arrange your files that way--that's bad practice!
Five-digit numbered files might not be found by the program unless they are surrounded by - or _ characters. ALSO, warn that if there are numbers in folders other than the intended sorting five-digit numbers, it could mess up the folder names in ways the user doesn't want.

NOTE: To make use of this, art files which are finalized and ready for publication must be named beginning with _FINAL or _final (case doesn't matter). The script will sort and rename finalized works (so named) by date of creation.

(For the as-yet undescribed foldo mojo, that must also be _final)
