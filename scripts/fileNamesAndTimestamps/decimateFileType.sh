# DESCRIPTION
# Counts all files of type $1 in the current directory, then deletes every one that is not a multiple of $2 minus one. Sorts by file create date before deleting, so that e.g. animation frames will stay in order. NOTE that the formula is $2 minus one because this preserves the first frame.

# USAGE
# With this script in your PATH, run it with these parameters:
# - $1 the file type to search for (in the current directory only).
# - $2 the multiple of those files to _keep_ when counting and deleting them. All files of type $1 which are _not_ multiples of $2 will be deleted. (Actually $2 minus 1; see DESCRIPTION.)
# Example which will delete every png image in the current directory that is not a multiple of 3:
#    decimateFileType.sh png 3
# You may wish, after running this script, to run renumberFiles.sh (see the USAGE comment in that script) to make e.g. animation frame numbers in files contiguous again.
