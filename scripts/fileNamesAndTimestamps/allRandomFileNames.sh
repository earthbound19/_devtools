# DESCRIPTION
# Renames files with random character strings of length n (parameter $1, and a default is used if not provided), but with the same file extension.

# WARNINGS
# - Depending on how you use this, it can randomly rename _all_ files in the current directory (non-recursive; it will not rename files in subfolders). It will keep the same file extensions (a file with a .png or .hexplt or any extension will still have that; it will just have a randomly different base file name).
# - Very bad things might happen (e.g. permanent data loss!) if you do not pass parameters as instructed here under USAGE. The script errors out for known scenarios that can lead to that, but I make no guarantees that this script is safe if misused (or even if properly used for that matter).

# USAGE
# Run with these parameters:
# - $1 OPTIONAL. How many random characters to have in each file name (length of file name). If not provided, a default is used.
# - $2 OPTIONAL. Extension of files to randomly rename. Only files with this extension will be renamed. If not provided, or if provided as keyword 'ALL', files of all extensions in the current directory will be randomly renamed.
# Example command to rename all files with the extension .hexplt to 20-character random strings:
# - $3 OPTIONAL. Keyword to bypass warnings and do destructive work without warning. ONLY USE THIS in a controlled script after testing on files you can afford to destroy (files that have secure backup somewhere else). If used, it must be the word 'SNEERFBLURN'.

# TO DO: check if the following math is right. I think it isn't, and effectively sets it to $(( getNrandChars * (-1) )) ; although it probably works out for the same intended effect; ALSO SEE rndHexColorsGen.sh for a possibly more elegant way to do this:
# Initialize counter at negative the number of getNrandChars, so that the first iteration in the following loop will set it to 0, which is where we need it to start:
multCounter=-$getNrandChars
	# echo multCounter val is $multCounter
for filename in ${fileNamesArray[@]}
do
	fileExt=${filename##*.}
	# For file renaming, grab next n random characters from pre-generated randomCharsString:
	num=$((multCounter + num2))
		# echo multCounter val is $multCounter
		# echo getNrandChars vlas is $getNrandChars
		multCounter=$(($multCounter + $getNrandChars))
		# echo getNrandChars val is $getNrandChars
		newFileBaseName=${randomCharsString:$multCounter:$getNrandChars}
		echo "~ Renaming $filename to $newFileBaseName"."$fileExt . . ."
	mv ./$filename ./$newFileBaseName.$fileExt

# DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
# 2020-09-10 Added optional paramter $3 password to bypass prompts and force destructive work. Upgraded to better command substitution + true arrays.
# 2020-07-09 12:22 Throw errors if non-numeric first parameter and exit. Change default rnd chars retrieved to 8.
# ????-??-?? Made this keep extensions. this is quick and dirty for flam3 files. 06/12/2016 09:15:44 AM -RAH -- DONE 2016-07-16 6:33 PM -RAH
# 2016-07-16 Made script much more efficient by prefetching necessary number of random characters into a variable, and fetching iterative groups of chars from said variable (in memory, instead of using a file on disk). -RAH
# 2018-12-01 11:33 PM Generate file list (fileNamesArray) in memory (skip writing temp files), layout niggles, delete some comments
