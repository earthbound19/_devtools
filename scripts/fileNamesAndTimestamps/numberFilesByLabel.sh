# DESCRIPTION
# Incremental file number naming by label utility. Finds the highest numbered file having both the phrase _FINAL_ and a five-padded number (nnnnn) in the file name, and renames file names which have _FINAL_ in them but no five-padded numbers; *adding* incremented five-padded numbers to those file names (to number all such _FINAL_ files by incrementing numbers). Handy for incrementally numbering e.g. a lot of new original abstract art work master image file names; or numbering e.g. abstract works.

# TO DO
# - deprecate sections of this relying on slow (not database of a monitored file system driven) 'nix search commands, and use everythingCLI instead (as in indexWorksByLabel.sh).
# - break the deprecated sections out into if blocks that run depending on detected platform (windows or 'nixy system).
# - fix bug where file names which mistakenly have _FINAL_ twice in the name don't register (apparently) as a five-padded number. OR: warn this should never be.
# - determine whether any sed flag will make e.g. _[fF][iI][nN][aA][lL] unecessary as a search pattern (case-insenstitive search). My first searches for this said no . . .
# - In this script, make the following variables actually do anything :) which will mean case-insensitive regexes in sed maybe, or which whuh i dunno? :
# - improve the following description in the line of code starting with 'echo WARNING\:'.


# CODE
labelOne=_FINAL_
labelTwo=_work_

echo WARNING\: This script will produce undesired results if any file names in the directory tree you run it from include the phrase var\, variant\, or variation. Nope\, you have to rename those files to avoid problems\, sorry. IMPORTANT NOTES\: This script will find\, and build a script to optionally batch rename files for this goal\: incrementally number files which include the full phrase $labelOne in their file name \(it must have underscores on both sides of it\)\. The incremental numbering will start off the highest found five-padded number \(format nnnnn\) alongside $labelOne *and* the full phrase $labelTwo\, followed by a five-digit number \(e\.g\. "$labelTwo"_00088\)\. ALSO NOTE\: filenames must be properly named with underscores _ instead of spaces\, and also any nnnnn numbers must be surrounded by underscores\, for this to work. To get files nearer to or at that standard\, see the notes at the start of __DigitalImagePress.sh.

# List all files in tree with $labelOne (upper or lowercase or mix) in their file name; also limited to file types we filter for:
find . -type f -iname "*_[fF][iI][nN][aA][lL]_*" > _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt
# wipe lines that end with file name extensions we don't need to be concerned with:

	# NOTE that for determining highest labelTwo count, $labelOne and $labelTwo are both guard-phrases; no file name without *both* those strings will be examined. Now, from fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt, divine the highest five-padded number accompanying the phrase $labelTwo "$labelTwo"00088 (e.g. _work_:00088) :
# strip all files out of that list that have the following regexes; because in my numbering scheme, color and animated etc. variants of a work don't get whole new work number:
sed -i 's/.*[vV][aA][rR][iI][aA][nN][tT].*//g' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt
	# Also blank out lines that include the word "variation" (again case insensitive):
sed -i 's/.*[vV][aA][rR][iI][aA][tT][iI][oO][nN].*//g' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt
sed -i 's/.*[vV][aA][rR].*//g' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt
# delete resulting empty lines (unsure if strictly necessary) :
sed -i '/^\s*$/d' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt

# Reduce fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt to only files that also have the phrase $labelTwo in the file name:
sed -n 's/\(.*_[wW][oO][rR][kK]_.*\)/\1/p' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithLabelOne.txt > _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithBothLabels.txt 
sed -n 's/.*_[wW][oO][rR][kK]_\([0-9]\{5\}\)_.*/\1/p' _batchNumbering/fileNamesWithBothLabels.txt > _batchNumbering/numbersFromFileNames.txt

	# List all files which have $labelOne in the file name, but which do *not* have $labelTwo; which can be done by concatenating the two found labels lists, sorting them, then reducing the file to all lines which did not have any duplicates (meaning, if there is more than one copy of any line, remove the copies *and* the original line also--or in other words, print only unique lines, re a genius breath yon: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/05/uniq-command-examples).

# DEVELOPMENT LOG
# 01/24/2016 12:42:00 AM re-check and bugfix session of this batch script DONE. Mind what is left in the TO DO comments.
# 2017-01-14__06-05-32_AM VERY GREATLY simplified (and made more truly functional as intended, I think) this script. Prior version copied to ./_deprecated/numberFilesByLabel_v0.9.17.sh
