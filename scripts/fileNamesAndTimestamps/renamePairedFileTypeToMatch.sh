# DESCRIPTION
# This script should not exist. I hope I never need to use it again.
# Scenario: you have a lot of preset files of type $1 (say, .cgp) from which you have rendered target files $2 (say, .png). However, because you are silly and didn't ensure the rendered files have names that give you any clue what preset or source they were rendered from, you have no way of knowing which presets you want to dispose of also. This script attempts to solve that problem through guesswork.
# It assumes:
# - The batch that rendered the presets listed them in default find sort order
# - The default find sort order of the rendered files matches the sort order of the sources. If so, all $2 can be renamed to match all $1.

# WARNING
# ONLY RUN THIS BATCH ON COPIES of the files, then verify the renames are correct. Why? because it renames all $2 to match all $1 on that assumption, which could be wrong.

# USAGE
# Run with these parameters:
# - $1 the file extension of the source files 
# - $2 the format of the target/rendered/mystery companion files which need to be renamed to match all $1. Don't include the . in the format; just the extension
# An example command that where the source files are .cgp format and the targets are .png:
#    renamePairedFileTypeToMatch.sh cpg png
# To express that in variables that read more like a sentence, but this would not be a practical command, because you would never have extensions with those names:
#    renamePairedFileTypeToMatch.sh sourceExtension targetExtensionMysteryFiles
