# DESCRIPTION
# Creates a .ppm (plain text file bitmap format) image which is W x H pixels of random colors OR colors from a list. Generates Z such images. See USAGE for script parameters and examples.

# USAGE
# Pass this script the following parameters; the last being optional:
# $1 How many pixels wide wide you want a random image grid to be
# $2 How many pixels tall ~
# $3 How many such random images you want to create
# $4 A file list of hex color values to randomly pick from (instead of doing "completely" pseudo-random colors). May or may not result in all colors from source list showing up in final image--it depends on psuedo-random "chance."
# $5 any value (e.g. "foo") reads colors sequentially (don't pick at random) from input file.
# $6 any value (e.g. "florghulment") shuffles the input list randomly, then reads the shuffled list sequentially. This guarantees all colors from the list will be in the final image, but in random order. NOTE however that if you provide a source list and numbers too small in parameters $1 and $2, this will not list all colors from the list.
# AFTER RUNNING this script you may wish to run e.g.:
# imgs2imgsNN.sh ppm png 4280 4280
# -- see the comments in imgs2imgsNN for details.

# EXAMPLE COMMANDS
# Generate one hundred and seventy 16x9 pixel files of colors picked randomly from the color hex code list file rainbowHexColorsByMyEye.txt:
# thisScript.sh 16 9 170 rainbowHexColorsByMyEye.txt


# TO DO: get this using the root hex colors list dir location that summat other script then there used.
# TO DO: as much of this script as possible in-memory instead of on disk, to speed it up dramatically.
# TO DO make the cols / rows paramater input sequence consistent between this and makeBWGridRandomNoise.sh, if they aren't (check).
# TO DO: set default values if no $1 $2 and $3 variables passed to script. Make this take string/switch parameters using em wah dut that testing that.
# TO DO: If param $5 passed (can have any value) to script, go through the list sequentially (no randomization).
# TO DO: if $4 then override numRows to  include everything in list.

# if $6 was passed to script, "randomly" shuffle the elements of the source file into a temp file, and generate the array from that. If no $6, just copy the file (without shuffling it) into a temp file, create the array from the temp file, and destroy the temp file.
