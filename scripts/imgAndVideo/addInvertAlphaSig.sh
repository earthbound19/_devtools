# DESCRIPTION
# Adds a signature or watermark image to an image in an inverse cut-out style (see USAGE).

# USAGE
# Invoke with two parameters, being
# $1 the image on which to overlay a signature with an invert background, with a transparent "cut-out" signature within
# $2 the image to use for the transparent signature cut-out, with the cut-out area being fully transparent in the image, and the background around that area being solid white. How the heck you do that? Start with white cut-out area on black, export invert the image, use filter forge unmultiply. Wait. You could start with it black on white and make sure the background is filled white (not transparent).
# EXAMPLE INVOCATION:
# addInvertAlphaSig.sh in.png signature_alpha.png

# TO DO: identify source of problem:
# NOTES: this doesn't work as such with some images. Maybe the fully transparent area has to be black, but with fully transparent alpha? Sheesh if so.

# TO DO before the following: make it not crop off the part of the source image that doesn't fit, OR expand the canvas of pic_invert~ to the original image size, without any background; re: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12186759
