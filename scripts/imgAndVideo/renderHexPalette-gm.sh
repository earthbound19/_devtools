# DESCRIPTION
# Takes a list of hex color codes, one per line, and renders a PNG image composed of tiles of those colors (a palette image), via GraphicsMagick.

# DEPENDENCIES
# - GraphicsMagick
# - A file `~/palettesRootDir.txt` (in your home folder) which contains one line, which is a Unix-style path to the folder where you keep hex palette (`.hexplt`) files.

# USAGE
# Run this script with the following parameters:
# - $1 hex color palette flat file list (input file).
# - $2 OPTIONAL. Edge length of each square tile to be composited into final image. If not provided a default is used.
# - $3 OPTIONAL. If not provided, or provided as string 'NULL' (don't use the single quote marks), the order of elements in the palette will be preserved. If provided and anything other than NULL (for example 2 or foo or 1 or 3), the script will randomly shuffle the hex color files before compositing them to one image. I have gone back and forth on requiring this in the history of this script :/
# - $4 OPTIONAL. Number of tiles across of tiles-assembled image (columns).
# - $5 OPTIONAL. IF $4 IS PROVIDED, you probably want to provide this also, as the script does math you may not want if you don't provide $5. Number of tiles down of tiles-assembled image (rows).
# EXAMPLE COMMAND; create a palette image from the hex color list RGB_combos_of_255_127_and_0_repetition_allowed.hexplt, where each tile is a square 250px wide, the palette image being 5 columns wide and 6 rows down, with squares in the palette rendered in random order:
#    renderHexPalette-gm.sh RGB_combos_of_255_127_and_0_repetition_allowed.hexplt 250 foo 5 6
# ANOTHER EXAMPLE COMMAND; create a palette image from tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt, with each tile 300 pixels wide, no shuffling, the script deciding how many across and down to make the tiles:
#    renderHexPalette-gm.sh tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt 300 tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt
# ANOTHER EXAMPLE COMMAND; use the same palette and let the script use all defaults:
#    renderHexPalette-gm.sh tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt


# CODE
# TO DO
# - UM. WOULDN'T THIS BE A TON FASTER creating a ppm and then upscaling it by nearest neighbor method?! Redo script (or make variant method script) for that?! -- trying that in hexplt2ppm.sh.
# - Adapt this to do double-wide half-down ratios by multiples of two, e.g. 4:2, 8:4, 16:8 etc. (not just 2:1).
# - Allow handling of a hex color on any line with or without # in front of it.
# - Allow comments in .hexplt files (decide on a parse marker for them and ignore all whitespace before that marker, and also ignore the marker itself and everything after it on the line).
# - Math to determine tile size dynamically for a target total image resolution?
