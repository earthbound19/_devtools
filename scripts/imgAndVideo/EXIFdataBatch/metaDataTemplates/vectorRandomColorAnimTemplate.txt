See http://replaceThisURL for archive, print and use options. Doodled, scanned, fixed up, vectorized and animated by yours truly. Individual frames colorings were accomplished by random selection of colors and fill from the list WHY_DIDNT_I_REPLACE_THIS_STUB_TEXT_OMIGOSH at: http://s.earthbound.io/ColorSchemesHex (and/or possibly by manual color fills). Scripts used to prep and animate this are (also from _ebdev) : potraceAllBMPs.sh, BWsvgRandomColorFill.sh, renumberFiles.sh [svg], allSVG2img.sh, ffmpegAnim.sh. Tools used: A flatbed scanner, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator (for svg node reduction while preserving virtually identical appearance), Inkscape, LibreOffice draw, k-meleon (for quick svg previews), cygwin (to enable all of the listed .sh scripts), ffmpeg (to create the video via ffmpegAnim.sh) and svgo_optimize.sh (which has a nodejs and svgo module dependency; you can also just use the SVGOMG web service (do a web search--you can use it to optimize an svg and prepare it for use by BWsvgRandomColorFill.sh). ~ A hoity-toity robot talks about this work at http://s.earthbound.io/artgib
