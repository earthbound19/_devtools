Pencil decorative lines doodled and scanned, then fixed up. This animated sequence of variants was accomplished by random selection of colors and fill from the list turtleGreenTetradicEtcHex.txt at: http://ift.tt/2cuJ4gk and these scripts (also from _devtools): potraceAllBMPs.sh, BWsvgRandomColorFill.sh, renumberFiles.sh [svg], allSVG2PNG.sh, ffmpegAnim.sh [1.6 29.97 20 png]. Tools used: A flatbed scanner, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator (for svg node reduction while preserving virtually identical appearance), Inkscape, LibreOffice draw, Internet Explorer (for quick svg previews), cygwin (to enable all of the listed .sh scripts), ffmpeg (to create the video via ffmpegAnim.sh) and the SVGOMG web service (to optimize an svg and prepare it for use by BWsvgRandomColorFill.sh).
