? = maybe?

Preference: don't duplicate data types across different tag types (EXIF/IPTC) unless necessary. Argh. Maybe let's pretend they are for tupid image metadata uses of tupid web sites :(

UPDATE: after the toil of finding the following EXIF/IPTC equivalents, I find the following URL, where exiftool implements an industry consortium standard for synchronizing these! : http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/MWG.html

"The table below lists special Composite tags which are used to access other tags based on the MWG 2.0 recommendations. These tags are only accessible when explicitly loaded, but this is done automatically by the exiftool application if MWG is specified as a group for any tag on the command line, or manually with the -use MWG option."

MWG Regions Tags could probably be used to automatically crop an image for myriad target devices/media.
