# DESCRIPTION
# Find all corrupt images of type $1 in the current directory, and move them into an /_irrecoverable subdirectory for examination.

# DEPENDENCIES
# GraphicsMagick (gm identify)

# USAGE
# Run this script with one parameter, which is an image file extension type without any . in it. For example:
#    identifyCorruptIMGs.sh png
# NOTE
# To dump any errors to a text file from graphicsmagic, run this command:
#
#    gm identify 1489.jpg 2> wut.txt


# CODE
# TO DO: am I doing the same thing as here? And share it there if I am but doing it better: https://www.davidebarranca.com/2018/05/automated-check-for-corrupted-image-files-with-python-and-ImageMagick/
