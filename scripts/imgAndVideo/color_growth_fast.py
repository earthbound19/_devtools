# DESCRIPTION
# The content of this file was pasted over color_growth.py; SEE THAT. This file is where an improved version of color_growth.py was forked to (by scribblemaniac), but that improvement was pasted over the original. This file is only here because web links may point to this, and I don't want anyone to hit a dead end looking for it.
