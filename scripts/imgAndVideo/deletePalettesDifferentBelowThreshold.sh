# DESCRIPTION
# Last of a series of scripts designed to eliminate similar .hexplt format palettes. Interactively launches pairs of rendered palettes corresponding to .hexplt files found to be similar (not so different below a rating threshold), as discovered by listPaletteDifferencesBelowThreshold.sh (which must be run first). Logs how many comparisons have been examined and allows resume from Nth comparison (see USAGE).
# For assistance with managing copies of palettes (in favorites collections), this script optionally uses everythingCLI (if it makes a successful attempt to run an executable of that name in a way that will produce no error), for statistics on how many copies of given images are found on your (Windows) computer. See USAGE for details.

# DEPENDENCIES
# - run of a previous script and anything it depends on (see USAGE)
# - A default image editor associated with the image files in the list which this script depends on (paletteDifferencesBelowThreshold.txt)
# - Optionally, everythingCLI (see DESCRIPTION)

# USAGE
# Before this script, run listPaletteDifferencesBelowThreshold.sh (which tells you to run another script before it), to generate the list paletteDifferencesBelowThreshold.txt. Then run with or without this parameter, and follow the prompts:
# - $1 OPTIONAL. Comparison number to start from, if this script was run prior but interrupted midway or if you want to skip some for any other reason. As the script runs, it logs each comparison iteration to deletePalettesDifferentBelowThresholdLog.txt. If the script is interrupted you may examine that file to know what iteration was last looked at by examining that file, then resume from that point.
# For example if the log file reads:
#    Iteration 320 of 794, pair CikkUp54.png | DNRi4NKs.png . . .
# To resume from that comparision, you may run this script with that first number:
#    deletePalettesDifferentBelowThreshold.sh 320
# The script will skip all iterations up to 320 and resume from there.
# To examine all iterations, run this script without any parameter:
#    deletePalettesDifferentBelowThreshold.sh 320
# NOTES
# - This script detects whether everythingCLI is installed and executes normally, and if so, it enables you to pick favorite palettes and copy them into palette collections, by printing information about how many copies of the palette (ASSUMED: in .hexplt format) are found on your computer. If this script prints information on the count of that palette file found on the computer, you'll know you don't need to copy the palette to another location (a collection), as it has already been copied (there are 2 or more of it).
# - If this script gets an error on attempt to run everythingCLI, it will print a count for a palette with a question mark, which indicates that the number of them on the computer is unknown.
