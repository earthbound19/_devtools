# DESCRIPTION: get shortened image names as junction links in a subfolder.

# TO DO: Maybe just make this all an AHK script. Blegh in two parts. BUT: it works, and time to rework it is money. If it works don't fix it . . . I now overrule my speculation. NO. Shall not. 10/10/2015 10:38:02 PM -RAH

		# DEVELOPMENT ONLY; comment out these indented lines in production:
		# echo RESETTING development test files . . .
		# rm *.jpg
		# rm *.png
		# 7z x -y devCopiedSelection.7z

		# ARGH! After going through the extreme pains of creating this script with so many steps to shorten names according to so many rules, I discover there is a command built into 'nix that will do this with regular expressions, again thanks to a genius breath at: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/33060/linux-script-or-program-to-shorten-filenames
		# The tool is simply called "rename," and it's built into my install of cygwin! TO DO: learn about *all* 'nix commands/tools/executables that ship therewith (or on any system).
		# EXCEPT that tool also will not rename files longer than 100 chars! Sheesh. My own AutoHotkey solution (windows only :() will, however.

# TO DO: Severely abridge the following warning to avoid tl;dr

# TO DO: UNCOMMENT THESE INDENTED LINES in production:
	echo "!============================================================"
	echo "This script will create shorter named junction links of all images in the directory you run this from. It will create the shorter name junctions in a subdirectory named _short_symlinks. The junction links will also correct characters in file names (such as spaces) which can louse up scripts. If you understand and accept this, please feel free to continue. If you don't, please type 2 and press enter. Also please note: until/unless this script is fixed, it will throw an error message about two files being the same. This means nothing (nothing has happened), so it's not anything to be concerned about. But maybe you will be anyway. Maybe you have an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. Please get help if you might. Or laugh at the silly writer of this script."

# ===== REVISION HISTORY =====
# 2015-09-28 v0.9 essential algorithms complete
# 10/05/2015 v0.95 v1 file renaming functionality via fixIMGnames.sh complete.
# 10/07/2015 v1 Debugging of minor errors complete.
# 10/10/2015 v1.01 BUG FIX; it will not properly shorten file names longer than 100 chars from cygwin; replaced that failed functionality by creating makeIMGjunctionsBatch.ahk/.exe and invoking that from this for file renaming/shortening/junction link creation.
