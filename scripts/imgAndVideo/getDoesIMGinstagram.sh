# DESCRIPTION
# Retrieves the aspect of an image as a decimal and informs you (to do: and does stuff based on) whether the image falls within Instagram's allowed aspects of 0.8:1 to 1.9:1 (WxH) for uploads.

# NOTE Image aspects and dimensions allowed by Instagram are 0.8:1 through 1.9:1 and it may upload images larger than 1080px on a side but it will always shrink them to that if not to 600 px on a side. re: https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723 -- and other URLs in comments in this script.

# USAGE
# Run with one parameter, being the image file name to check for Instagram aspect restraints fit (for upload), e.g.:
#    getDoesIMGinstagram.sh ./_EXPORTED_M_variantWork_00099_FFsideToside_v02_PZ-8280x.jpg
# NOTE that if you run this script with the source command before it, e.g.:
#    source getDoesIMGinstagram.sh ./_EXPORTED_M_variantWork_00099_FFsideToside_v02_PZ-8280x.jpg
# -- then the boolean variable $doesInstagram created by this script survives in the shell (for e.g. another script to use) after this script returns.

# DEPENDENCIES
# GraphicsMagick, and a 'nix environment with the bc command-line calculator.

# TO DO
# Algebra if image is outside allowed aspect range to determine padding necessary to bring it into acceptable range; AND/OR to do that anyway along with padding image with a color scheme printout derived from it.

# Decision? if source image exceeds max. allowed aspect, do maths to find pad image dimensions targeting aspect 1.38. or 1.65? or min. .22 less on aspect? -- target aspect 1.727 looks best in try off max allowed aspect img. ALSO if past a certain aspect (which?) FUHGETTABOUTIT.
# Decision? if source aspect is below min. allowed, do maths to find pad image dimensions targeting aspect 1.2. or 1.1? or min .22 more on aspect? ALSO if too narrow, FUHGETTABOUTIT.
