# DESCRIPTION
# Makes a teensy ppm palette image (one pixel per color) from a hex palette .hexplt source file. Result is usable as a basis for a scaled up palette image via e.g.:
# img2imgNN.sh ppm png 640 480

# USAGE
# Invoke this script with the following parameters:
#  $1 hex color palette flat file list (input file).
#  $2 OPTIONAL. Number of tiles across of tiles-assembled image (columns). If not provided, automatically calculated as approximate square root of total number of colors in source .hexplt file.
#  $3 OPTIONAL. IF $2 IS PROVIDED, you probably want to provide this also, as the script does math you may not want if you don't provide $3. Number of tiles down of tiles-assembled image (rows).
#  EXAMPLE COMMANDS:
# With this script in your PATH:
#  hexplt2ppm.sh RAHfavoriteColorsHex.hexplt 5 40
#  --creates a tiny ppm palette image from the hex color list RAHfavoriteColorsHex.hexplt,
#  which is 5 tiles across and 40 tiles down.
#  hexplt2ppm.sh RAHfavoriteColorsHex.hexplt
#  -- creates a tiny ppm image of that palette file, with columns and rows calculated by the script.

# KNOWN ISSUES
# - Uh, this seems to not even produce the colors intended at all in the resultant ppm on Windows.
#  I wonder whether that is also an issue on Mac.
# - Sometimes Cygwin awk throws errors as invoked by this script. Not sure why. I run it twice and one time awk throws an error, another it doesn't.

# - Make gray padding optional? Does it substantially slow down ppm creation?

# I don't know *how* this combination of flags works; it was a shot in the dark (!), but it works; hints from https://stackoverflow.com/a/1665574/1397555 ; ALSO, the \L converts all preceding characters which are uppercase to lowercase :

	#  - Isolate last line of ppmBody.txt to count those values; re http://www.theunixschool.com/2012/05/7-different-ways-to-print-last-line-of.html :
	#  - pipe the last line of ppmBody to grep and search for number pattern, then pipe to word count (wc), and store all that in the variable lastLineValuesCount:
	# Because AGAIN windows line endings created by one ported gnu utility are conflicting with unix line endings created by another ported gnu utility:

	lastLineValuesCount=`echo $lastLineString | grep -o '[0-9]\{1,\}' | wc -l | tr -d ' '`

	#  - Alas this can't be done as elegantly as printf "ha "%.0s {1..5} with a variable in the range, re https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19432753/brace-expansion-with-variable :
