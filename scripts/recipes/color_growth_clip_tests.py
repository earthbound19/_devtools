# DESCRIPTION
# Tests all possible `--GROWTH_CLIP` rates of color_growth.py, by running it repeatedly, saving .cgp presets for each of the same.

# USAGE
# Run this script through a Python interpreter, without any parameters:
#    python /path/to/this/script/color_growth_clip_tests.py
# NOTE
# This assumes that color_growth.py is in your PATH, and searches for it (which can cause a delay at the start). If you're in a hurry, hard-code the pathToColorGrowthPy variable to the correct path, and comment out the path search code.


# CODE
# TO DO
# - use platform.system() to identify the shell we should call to find the script path, as in a comment below
import itertools
import subprocess
import shlex
import numpy as np
import re
import datetime
import os
import sys

# FIND color_growth.py, assuming it is anywhere in the system or user PATH:
print ('Searching for color_growth.py in PATH . . .')
    # FOR A HORROR SHOW DETOUR:
    # print(os.environ)
    # OR:
    # for item, value in os.environ.items():
        # print('{}: {}'.format(item, value))
# This fails to find the path on windows unless you have .sh scripts associated with MSYS2 or whatever you're using for Unix-like emulation; a workaround could be changing the next call by reading the return of platform.system() (after importing platform) and then directly calling the MSYS2 termianl app and passing that script, assuming that MSYS2 terminal app is in your PATH:
proc=subprocess.Popen('getFullPathToFile.sh color_growth.py', shell=True, stdout = subprocess.PIPE, )
pathToColorGrowthPy = proc.communicate()[0]
# That's in some byte encoding or summat I can't use; but this this function automagically clears it up:
pathToColorGrowthPy = pathToColorGrowthPy.decode()
# that has a newline before it which throws everything if I try to run it right after 'python' in a terminal; strip that newline:
pathToColorGrowthPy = re.sub('\n', '', pathToColorGrowthPy)

if pathToColorGrowthPy == '':
    print('Path to script color_growth.py not found. Exit.')
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print('Path to color_growth.py found: ', pathToColorGrowthPy)

# build set of tuples we want to pass to the --GROWTH_CLIP switch of color_growth.py; ALAS that at this writing it no longer accepts negative values, so a prior used set is commented out on the next line, and the actual usable one is uncommented:
# original_set = {-11,-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
original_set = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
original_tuples = itertools.permutations(original_set, 2)
clip_tuples = set()
for element in original_tuples:
    if element[0] < element[1] and element[1] > 0:
        clip_tuples.add(element)

# Run color_growth.py so many times with those tuples, and random colors, saving datetime and tuple-named .cgp presets and loading for each run:
for element in clip_tuples:
    rgb_color_triplet = np.random.randint(0, 255 + 1, size=3)
    foreground_color = list(rgb_color_triplet)
    # Inverts the color;
    #  subtracts all the elements of the numpy array from 255,
    #  returns that as a numpy array and converts it to a list:
    background_color = list(255 - rgb_color_triplet)
    background_color = re.sub(' ', '', str(background_color))
    foreground_color = re.sub(' ', '', str(foreground_color))
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    time_stamp = now.strftime('%Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S__')
    growth_clip_file_name_str = time_stamp + 'growth_clip_' + str(element[0]) + '_' + str(element[1]) + '.cgp'
    preset_string = '--WIDTH 520 --HEIGHT 240 -q 1 -a 1 -b ' + background_color + ' -c ' + foreground_color + ' --RSHIFT 12 --SAVE_EVERY_N 0 --GROWTH_CLIP ' + str(element)
    file = open(growth_clip_file_name_str, "w")
    file.write(preset_string + '\n\n')
    file.close()
    command_string = 'python "' + pathToColorGrowthPy + '" --LOAD_PRESET ' + growth_clip_file_name_str
    print('Will run command via subprocess: ', command_string)
    subprocess.call(shlex.split(command_string))
    print('Subprocess completed.')
