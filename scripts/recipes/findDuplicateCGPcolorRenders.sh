# DESCRIPTION
# This script is for a highly custom and hard-to-describe scenario. It finds all .cgp and .sh format files which contain the transformed RGB color triplet patterns in a .rgbplt file (which was used with a color_growth_hexplt.sh batch run or runs), for the current directory. See USAGE. It is possible I will fix the root scripting / render design problems that lead to the need of this script, and thereby obsolete this script.
# Yes, I could just accept multiple renders from the same origin coordinate color in a batch. But no, it's a creative choice.

# USAGE
# Stated problem: I ran and interrupted and resumed color_growth_hexplt.sh repeatedly, resulting in more than one cgp preset for every color in the converted .rgbplt file. I want to narrow it down to one render per color in the palette, deleting any more than one render per color in the palette, keeping the more favorable ones.
# This script lists all .cgp and .sh files in the current directory which have a color RGB tuple format (e.g. '[212,123,57]', but without single quote marks) transformed from the original .rgbplt format (e.g. '212 123 57' without single quote marks). I can then find the corresponding .png files rendered from those .cgp presets, and delete all but my favorite cgp and corresponding png render (pruneByUnmatchedExtension.sh will help there) files, keeping the one that I like best.
# To get help with that, after you've finished all renders via color_growth_hexplt.sh (after it runs the whole script without doing any more renders, assuming you leave all .rendering stub files intact), run this script with one parameter, which is the .rgbplt file to run this analysis for, e.g.:
#    findDuplicateCGPcolorRenders.sh collectedColors1.rgbplt
# Results will be stored in findDuplicateCGPcolorRenders_sh__log.txt.
