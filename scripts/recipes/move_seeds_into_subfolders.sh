# DESCRIPTION
# This was a one-use script; it fixes something that happened before I fixed randomNsetChars.pde to do it. Reads seeds (for randomNsetChars.pde) from seeds.txt in a folder above so many animation frame subfolders, and writes those seeds into text files named after the seeds, in the subfolders. To identify seeds that generated random animation images.

# USAGE
# Run this script without any parameter:
#    move_seeds_into_subfolders.sh


# CODE
folders=( $(find . -type d -printf '%f\n' | sort -n | sed 's/.*[AM|PM] \.\/\(.*\)/\1/g') )
# the :1 in the following slices the array to omit
# the first element, ., which we don't want;
