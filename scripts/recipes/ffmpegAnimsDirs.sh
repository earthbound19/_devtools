# DESCRIPTION
# Runs ffmpegAnim.sh against every subfolder in the current folder, with default hard-coded values if you provide no parameters, or passing on to ffmpegAnim.sh whatever parameters you provide for this script. Renames the resulting animation videos after the respective subfolders. See USAGE and NOTES.

# USAGE
# From a directory with so many subdirectories, each with image series suitable for ffmpegAnim.sh (SEE), run this script. Run it without any parameters to use provided defaults, or pass to this script the same parameters that ffmpegAnim.sh will accept, and this script will pass those to ffmpegAnim.sh for every call of that script, for every subfolder. To use without any parameters, run like this:
#    ffmpegAnimsDirs.sh
# NOTES
# - For every render made from files in subfolders, this script renames the resultant _out.mp4 animation after the folder that contains the animation frames, and moves it one directory up from the folder.
# - Also, before it calls ffmpegAnim.sh for a subfolder, it checks if the animation video that would result from rendering already exists, and skips the render if it does (to avoid duplicating work, and also so that you may interrupt and resume renders from this script).
# - This script does not scan subfolders recursively; it will only operate on folders one folder level down from the current folder, and will not work on subfolders of those.
