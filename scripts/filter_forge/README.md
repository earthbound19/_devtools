# Filter Forge generative art data

These directories contain filters, filter presets, and other data related to the brilliant [Filter Forge](https://filterforge.com/) program.

The [`_published_by_Filter_Forge`](_published_by_Filter_Forge) sub-directory has fitlers I have made which are published by Filter Forge staff.

The [`my_presets`](my_presets) directory has `.ffxml` files containing presets corresponding to published Filter Forge filters (whether I made the filter or not). (The README.md in that folder also renders a gallery of previews of my custom presets.) These presets may be dropped into the `../../My Presets` directory relative to the folder in which the original filter resides in a Filter Forge install. To find that filter directory (with the filter file selected), alt-or-right-click on any filter listing in the Filter Forge library navigator and then click "Locate File." You will know the corresponding preset file in `/my_presets` because it is similarly named (has the same number-dash-number).

In particular, I use the `my_presets` sub-folder to publish presets in excess of the number which Filter Forge allows upon filter publication.

I'll happily review (and hopefully merge) pull requests that update presets for any of my filters.
