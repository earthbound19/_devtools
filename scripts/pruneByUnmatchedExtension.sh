# DESCRIPTION
# Helps discard files in the current folder (non-recursive) with a given 
# extension that have no companion file with the same file but a 
# different extension. Does this by moving the identified files into a 
# temp folder for review before permanent and manual deletion. Scenarios 
# this is useful in: suppose you have a set of render source or 
# configuration files (in my case it might be files of extension .cgp, or 
# .hexplt) for which you have rendered targets (e.g. .png images of color 
# growth script settings or palettes). You may then go through and delete 
# the .png results you don't like, and run this script to move all the 
# associated .cgp or .hexplt files into a temp folder. You can then review 
# the files in the temp folder and manually delete them. 
# WARNING
# If you use this on files with unintended dissimilar base file names such as thisFractalRenderFlame.flame.png, you will lose work!

# USAGE
# With this script in your PATH:
# pruneByUnmatchedExtension.sh extensionOfFilesToMove ifNoMatchedFilesWithThisExtension, e.g.:
# pruneByUnmatchedExtension.sh hexplt png
# -- will sort every file with extension extension .hexplt that has no
# same-named file with a .png extension into a temporary folder for manual
# analysis and deletion or recovery. NOTE that extensions passed as
# parameters must not include the dot (.).
# READ ON for a detailed explanation.
# Suppose you have so many .ppm files which you have converted to .png:
# ~
# img_01.ppm
# img_01.png
# img_02.ppm
# img_02.png
# img_03.ppm
# img_03.png
# img_04.ppm
# img_04.png
# ~
# -- and you decide you want to delete some of the source .ppm files 
# because you don't like the pngs they render to. First delete the 
#rendered pngs you don't like: 
# ~
# img_01.ppm
# img_02.ppm
# img_02.png
# img_03.ppm
# img_03.png
# img_04.ppm
# ~
# -- and then run this script with parameters that tell this script
# $1 the source file extension to search for matching file names
# with extension $2, where $1 will be deleted if no file with
# extension $2 is found. Example:
# ./thisScript.sh ppm png
# After the script run, ppm files that had no png with the same
# base file name:
# img_02.ppm
# img_02.png
# img_03.ppm
# img_03.png
# -- will be sorted into a new folder with a random name like:
# ___delete_candidates_tmp__BB01BF75857DDFE0
# -- where you can manually analyze them and delete them
# after you are sure you don't want them.

# NOTES
# This script intended to run e.g. after NrandomHexColorSchemes.sh and renderAllHexPalettes-gm.sh (which invokes renderHexPalette-gm.sh repeatedly for every .hexplt file in a directory), and renders and deletes of not desired converted pngs of those palettes, or after autobrood fractorium renders to prune undesired fractal flame genomes.
