# DESCRIPTION
# Collates documentation comments from all code/script files in the current directory and subdirectories into one file: `<repoName>_DOCUMENTATION.md` (assumes it is part of a git repository and names the first part of the file after the repository; if that isn't the case it may just end up named `_DOCUMENTATION.md`), for easier documentation reference. Uses a subset of Mardkwon to allow source code comments loosely styled after Markdown to be converted for final rendered documentation. See USAGE.

# USAGE
# In the source code of every script in this repository (or any other repository that you want to use this script for), follow this documentation convention:
# - REQUIREMENT. Write a documentationHeader.md file which introduces and generally describes this document, or otherwise introduces it. Also a documentationFooter.md document, which has whatever information you want to follow the general body document (which is made from documentation comments in so many scripts) with.
# - REQUIREMENT. Everything before a code begin comment marker is documentation that will be collated into <repoName>_DOCUMENTATION.md (adapted to markdown format) when you run this script.
# - REQUIREMENT. The code begin comment marker is simply the word 'CODE' (without the quote marks, and with no punctuation and no other words or anything else other than the comment marker, thought whitespace is allowed before or after the comment marker and/or the word 'CODE'). Supported comment markers are: #, //, %, ::, REM, ;, ;;, and possibly others I may add (check the awk command in this script). An example of a code begin marker for a powershell file would be:
#        % CODE
# - REQUIREMENT. Document important general information that is suitable for subheaders by writing only a comment marker, and any whitespace before and after, and an all-caps word, and _no other punctuation or character types. Examples of such headers are '# DESCRIPTION', '// USAGE', ';; NOTES', etc. (without the quote marks for any of those examples.) These will be converted to Markdown 4th-level headers.
# - REQUIREMENT. If the source code is an executable script (such as a python, bash or Perl script) which accepts CLI parameters, give examples of and explain those parameters. Indent example commands to run the script four spaces after the source code comment marker. Eight spaces if they follow a Markdown list item on the previous line (if the command example is with list items). Re: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
# - REQUIREMENT. Any documentation of commands that comes after headers and is intended to be presented as technical information (such as example commands) must first have a header, then at least one line of text immediately after that, then the technical information on the next line. This is a limitation of how I parse documentation, but it's also a preference (for example, to introduce the technical information, however briefly, on the line before it).
# - RECOMMENDATION. If documentation includes double dashes `--` as syntax, put the code containing that syntax on a separate line preceded by quadruple spaces, or else Pandoc will convert it to an em-dash for display, which is not correct. But you may also surround the syntax that is part of the `--` with backticks for inline preformatted (technical information/code) Markdown.
# - RECOMMENDATION. Where it is more useful (including for convenience sake), put markdown backticks around words or phrases inline right in text, even if it leads to syntactical confusion in readers of the comment source code (to wonder why those are there).
# - All documentation lines will have two spaces appended to the end of the line by this script, to force newlines in Markdown (to preserve intended newline breaks).
# - Even if a script requires no parameters to run, I prefer to give an example command to run the script, under a USAGE header, like this:
#    scriptName.sh parameterOne parameterTwo
# WITH ALL THOSE documentation requirements in place for every source code etc. file in a given repository, and to use this script to make good of so much documentation, and from a directory containing those code etc. files (and this script will also include files in subdirectories), run this script without any parameters:
#    makeDocumentation.sh
# (For the `_ebDev` repo, I run it from within the /scripts folder.)
# After parsing and collation, results will appear in `<repoName>_Documentation.md`.
# NOTES
# - For the curiosity of listing files newest first according to when they were first committed to git, before you run makeDocumentation.sh, first run this script, from the repository root:
#        setFileTimestampsToEarliestGitCommit.sh
# - The resultant `<repoName>_Documentation.md` file is expected to be large and frequently changing, so good practice is to not store it in a git repository; to exclude it via `.gitignore`.


# CODE
# DEVELOPER NOTES
# - Always ensure this list of supported comment markers is in both the AWK_CODE_MARKER_SEARCH_COMMAND (see commment with that string) and SED_COMMENT_STRIP_COMMAND (see also comment with that string): # // """ % :: REM ; ;;
# - To manually clean up my preference of not having a colon after all caps pseudo (not markdown) headers in code comments, I found them via npp search all files, with "Match case" ticked and "Regular expression" selected, and this find string: ^[#/%:RrEeMm ]*[[:UPPER:]]{1,}:$
# - I was not able to get semicolons to work in that expression.
# - list of all relevant extensions for NPP search-replace: *.py *.sh *.pl *.ahk *.ps *.ps1 *.cmd *.bat *.reg *.md

This will clobber any lines that have varying indents which are guides for humans to separate different logical blocks etc. I'm not fixing that.

Deprecated because it turns out that I do want more than four spaces before preformatted text in at least one setting: when it is immediately after a Markdown list item.
