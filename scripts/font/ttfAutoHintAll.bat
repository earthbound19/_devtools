REM prior version of ttfautohint might have used the -f argument to designate input file? The batch was formerly thus; it broke on new version. The batch as-is now (modified to discard the -f argument) works. These were the arguments for the prior version:
REM ttfautohint -i -l 8 -r 50 -G 0 -x 0 -w "GD" -W -p -f "%%F" "%%~nF_TTFAutoHinted.ttf"

REM Changed batch to make a copy of the source ttf, autohint from the copy, save to the original file name, and delete the copy. 08/29/2014 11:47:07 AM -RAH
