# DESCRIPTION
This repository is a collection of utilities, being executables and scripts (the latter of which I developed most of), which I use for development of many kinds--at this writing, mostly visual art development on Windows. It heavily relies on various 'nix/cygwin utilities.

I believe that everything here is at least freely available and open source. If you are the copyright owner of anything in this archive and wish for it to be removed, please contact me and I will do so.

# INSTALLATION AND USAGE:

Make a junction link to this directory, pointed to e.g. from one C:\devtools\_devbin, and put that same path in the system %PATH% (along with the paths to any other utilities or scripts in this repository that you will use).

To create a junction link, see:http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html

As these tools and scripts etc. can be in flux (meaning I edit and develop them as I use them, and/or I freely add or remove utilities from this archive.

This includes zeranoe's build of ffmpeg, AutoHotkey, and many gnu core utilities for windows 32-bit.

## ARCHIVE HISTORY:

- 03/13/2016 04:20:39 PM Dramatically expanded/reorganized to include a lot more that I'm using, and have developed and/or moved. -RAH
