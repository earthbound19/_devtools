I believe that all of the utilities in this folder and subfolder are at least freely available and open source. If you are the copyright owner of anything in this folder and wish for it to be removed, please contact me and I will do so.

INSTALLATION AND USAGE:

Note that these are all Windows utilities.

Make a junction link to this directory, pointed to e.g. from one C:\devtools\_devbin, and put that same path in the system %PATH% (along with any other utility or batch folders in this repository that you will use).

To create a junction link, see:http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html

As these tools and scripts etc. can be in flux (meaning I edit and develop them as I use them, and/or I freely add or remove utilities from this archive.

This includes zeranoe's build of ffmpeg, AutoHotkey, and gnu core utilities for windows 32-bit.
