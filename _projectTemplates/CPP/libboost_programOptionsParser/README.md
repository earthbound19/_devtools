This is a template--not in the programming sense--to start a C++ project with the boost console arguments library already "baked in". The development environment project (.cbp) is CODE::BLOCKS.

This program was written by Richard Alexander Hall (although essentially by someone else who made it public clearly for anyone to use without restriction). I deed this work to the Public Domain.
