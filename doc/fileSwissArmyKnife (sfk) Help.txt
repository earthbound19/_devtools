   help by subject
      sfk help select   - how dirs and files are selected in sfk
      sfk help options  - general options reference
      sfk help patterns - wildcards and text patterns within sfk
      sfk help chain    - how to combine (chain) multiple commands
      sfk help shell    - how to optimize the windows command prompt
      sfk help unicode  - about unicode file reading support
      sfk help colors   - how to change result colors
      sfk help xe       - for infos on sfk extended edition.
   
   All tree walking commands support file selection this way:

   1. short format with ONE directory tree and MANY file name patterns:
      src1dir .cpp .hpp .xml bigbar !footmp
   2. short format with a list of explicite file names:
      letter1.txt revenues9.xls report3\turnover5.ppt
   3. long format with MANY dir trees and file masks PER dir tree:
      -dir src1 src2 !src\save -file foosys .cpp -dir bin5 -file .exe

   For detailed help on file selection, type "sfk help select".

   * and ? wildcards are supported within filenames. "foo" is interpreted
   as "*foo*", so you can leave out * completely to search a part of a name.
   For name start comparison, say "\foo" (finds foo.txt but not anyfoo.txt).

   When you supply a directory name, by default this means "take all files".

      sfk list mydir                lists ALL  files of mydir, no * needed.
      sfk list mydir .cpp .hpp      lists SOME files of mydir, by extension.
      sfk list mydir !.cfg          lists all  files of mydir  EXCEPT .cfg

   general options:
      -tracesel tells in detail which files and/or directories are included
                or excluded, and why (due to which user-supplied mask).
      -nosub    do not process files within subdirectories.
      -nocol    before any command switches off color output.
      -quiet    or -nohead shows less output on some commands.
      -hidden   includes hidden and system files and dirs.
      For detailed help on all options, type "sfk help options".

   beware of Shell Command Characters.
      command parameters containing characters < > | ! & must be sur-
      rounded by quotes "". type "sfk filter" for details and examples.
