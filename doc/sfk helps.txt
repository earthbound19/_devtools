      sfk list logfiles .txt +filefilter -global-unique +tofile mixedlog.txt
         join all .txt files from logfiles into one output file mixedlog.txt,
         dropping all redundant text lines. works only if logfile records are
         prefixed by a unique record ID, and if overall text data is less than
         available memory, because all data is cached during processing.
      sfk list logfiles .txt +ffilter -global-unique -write -to mytmp\$file
      sfk snapto=mixedlog.txt mytmp
         same as above in two commands, using temporary files to allow more data.

      sfk replace    replaces many strings in parallel, in text and binary files.

      sfk view       a high speed GUI text filter tool. filters text lines instantly
                     as you type, with a simple syntax like "foo AND htm NOT html".
